# Python 101 - Introduction To Programming

These are the exercise labs for the first module of your CodingNomads Python Programming course.

You should find this document after downloading the repository. This folder contains **your own copy** of all the labs that you'll work with and learn from. Complete the exercises locally on your computer in your text editor or IDE.

## Use GitHub For Feedback

After you've learned about Git and GitHub, you can add a new remote to your labs folder and point it to a fresh GitHub repository on your own GitHub account.

Push your work there, and inform [your mentor](https://codingnomads.co/online-coding-bootcamp-mentorship) through chat or email if you want their feedback on any of the exercises. Even if you aren't working with a mentor, you can link to the code files you want to discuss in the [CodingNomads Forum](https://forum.codingnomads.co/). GitHub is built for collaboration, so it's a helpful tool in all of this.

## Contribute

There is always room for improvement, and as a budding software developer, learning to contribute to a project is a great first step to practice remote collaboration and learn about open-source software development practices.

CodingNomads appreciates Pull Requests. If you **find a typo**, or a **mistake in the code**, or if you want to **add an exercise** of your own for other students to learn from, you can suggest these improvements to the original repository.
