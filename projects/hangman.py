# Write a Hangman game in Python.
# Users should have a limited amount of attempts to guess a pre-defined word.
# Print feedback to the user when they made a guess,
# and keep track of and communicate their remaining attempts.

# Hard-code a word that needs to be guessed in the script

# Print an explanation to the user

# Display the word as a sequence of blanks, e.g. "_ _ _ _ _" for "hello"

# Ask for user input

# Allow only single-character alphabetic input

# Create a counter for how many tries a user has

# Keep asking them for their guess until they won or lost

# When they find a correct character, display the blank with the word
#   filled in, e.g.: "_ e _ _ _" if they guessed "e" from "hello"

# Display a winning message and the full word if they win

# Display a losing message and quit the game if they don't make it
