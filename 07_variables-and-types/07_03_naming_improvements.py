# The code below works as expected and there are no errors.
# However, the variable names aren't great and don't follow the guidelines.
# Improve the variable names so they follow the PEP-8 guidelines.

# Name = "Ada"             # Shouldn't start with a capital letter
# lastName = "Lovelace"    # Should use snake_case rather than camelCase
# FULLNAME = Name + " " + lastName  # Shouln't be all caps

# print(FULLNAME)


name = "Ada"
last_name = "Lovelace"
full_name = name + " " + last_name

print(full_name)
